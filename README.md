## JoriPass: a new way to experience NetPass!

Introducing JoriPass:

In the current state of the world, the 3DS is, sadly, on decline. That makes getting StreetPasses harder and harder, due to fewer and fewer people taking their 3DS with them on a walk. This is where JoriPass comes in!  
Unlike StreetPass, JoriPass works over the internet. Upon opening JoriPass, you can pick various locations to go to, i.e. NetPal's house, or Jori's cat bed. Upon entering a location, you get passes of others who are in the same location! And, while you are at the location, others who enter it can get passes with you. But beware! You can only switch locations once every 10 hours!
